in this project we want to detect some predefined shapes by using computer vision technology.
we use OpenCV library for development.
this shapes could be used to guide a drone find its path and target point.
one of the shape is an arrow which can be used to guide the drone's orientation.
for example if the arrow is like this -> then the drone should goes right.
